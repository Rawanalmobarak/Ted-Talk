https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/ted-talks

### Data Description:


### Data Content:
This dataset contains 6 different features of each talk available on TED's website which you can find below



### Data Dictionary:

- title - Title of the Talk
- author - Author of Talk
- date - Date when the talk took place
- views - Number of views of the Talk
- likes - Number of likes of the Talk
- link - Link of the talk from ted.com

### Data Cleaning:
The dataset had one row with missing values, looked up the link of the data and it turns out that the Author is missing because it's a compilation of popular videos in 2015
I removed the row with missing value

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Questions to explore:
- top 10 viewed/liked vidoes ✅

- top 10 popular videos (views, likes, and watch time) ✅

- The authors with the most number of talks ✅

- graph author with the the title of their ted talks ✅

- Does the most popular Author have a theme for his speeches?

- which month most of the ted talks were released ✅

- The newest & oldest ted talk in the dataset ✅

- Visualization of number of ted talks every year ✅

- Visualization of the words used in the popular ted talks

- find the correlation between popular videos title and number of views






### Conclusion:



Ted Talks Dates:
- "Do schools kill creativity?" released in 2006 is still the most popular Ted Talk Video based on the number of views and likes.

- Years : The oldest Ted Talks is in 1970 and we can see that the Ted talks started increasing in the 2000s. The maximum number of speeches were in 2019. We notice that there were less Ted talks in 2020 than 2019 and this could be because of the pandemic
- February and Novemeber are the most popular months to give a ted talk where August and January are least popular.

Author:
- The most popular Ted Talk Author is Alex Gendler, where he has 45 ted talk speeches.
- his most viewed ted talk is "can you solve the prisoner hat riddle"

### Future work:
- If the data had the duration of the videos, I would've loved to see how that would correlate to the views
- Would love to do some analysis on the words used in the titles
